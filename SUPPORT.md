## Do you have a question?

### Open Source Community
- If you're unsure why something isn't working or wondering if there is a better way of doing it please check on, the easiest way would be to ask question in the Steeltoe community slack forum at https://slack.steeltoe.io.   

### Pivotal Customer
- If you need immediate assistance and you are a [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io) customer, you should use the [technical support portal](https://pivotal.io/support).

### Other Support Channels
- Search Stackoverflow for your question or post your question there. Make sure to use the `steeltoe` tag so it brings it to our attention. 
- If you still are not getting the attention you need, you can create a github issue. This should be only after you have exhausted the other options.
